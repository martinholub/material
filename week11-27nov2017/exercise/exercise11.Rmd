```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


## Requirements
We will use the packages "MLSeq"" and "MLInterfaces". Please install both.
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(MLInterfaces)
library(MLSeq)
```

## Load the micro-RNA expression data

The package MLSeq has some micro-RNA expression data from normal (N) and tumor samples (T). These can be loaded with
```{r}
cervicalFile = system.file("extdata/cervical.txt", package = "MLSeq", mustWork = TRUE)
cervicalCounts = as.matrix(read.table(cervicalFile, header = TRUE))
head(cervicalCounts)
```


The true class for each sample is given by
```{r}
cervicalClass = factor(substr(colnames(cervicalCounts), 1,1))
head(cervicalClass)
```

## Normalization
Use edgeR's TMM normalization to normalize the counts. Use the log-transformed counts-per-million values with a `prior.count=10`.



## Visualization

Create an MDS plot to get an idea of the separability of the samples.

## Nonspecific filtering

In order to reduce the dimensionality, Use only those micro-RNAs where the row variance is larger then 0.5.

## k-nn classification

Implement a k-nn classification with cross-validation use the function `knn.cv` from the package `class`.

Compute the f1-score.

## MLInterfaces

Implement the same scheme using the MLInterfaces package., and using knn.cv's internal cross-valdiation scheme. For that the data needs to be casted in a variable of class `ExpressionSet`
```{r, eval=FALSE}
cervES = new("ExpressionSet", exprs=filteredLogCpm, phenoData=AnnotatedDataFrame(ds$samples))
```

The k-nn classifier with cross-validation is now implemented as

```{r, eval=FALSE}
knn1 = MLearn(trueClass~., cervES, knn.cvI(k=5), trainInd=1:ncol(cervES))
confuMat(knn1)
```


Setup a balanced k-fold cross-validation scheme
```{r, eval=FALSE}
k = 10
knnCv = MLearn(trueClass~., cervES, knnI(k=5), xvalSpec("LOG", k, balKfold.xvspec(k)))
```

## Other classifiers

Compute the performance of the diagonal linear discriminant analysis and support vector machines provided by MLInterfaces.
